# Overview

Our objective in this unit is to take the simple series and parallel systems covered in MUDE (material can be found [here](https://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/risk-reliability/reliability-system/overview.html)) and practice applying it to real problems. This requires taking a real system and breaking it down into smaller sub-systems and components. In our applications we will focus on:

- binary events/components (either safe or failed)
- constructing a system out of (mostly) simple series and parallel sub-systems
- primarily statistically independent components
- observing when dependence may occur and checking how it would influence the computed failure probability under a statistically independent assumption

In all cases, our goal will be to compute system failure probability, $p_{f,sys}$.

The primary tool for completing this analysis is the Fault Tree, which is introduced on the next page.
