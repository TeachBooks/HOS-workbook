# Workshop 02: Extreme Value Analysis

This workshop was assigned on GitHub, and can be accessed via [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/3HVLnujt) (you can still use it to do the assignment, but future submissions will not be reviewed).

The solution is provided here in the following three sub-pages, and is a subset of what was included in the repository:
- Report: the Markdown report with 5 questions about the analysis
- Analysis: the Jupyter notebook where calculations were made (includes additional explanation)
- Feedback: the general feedback provided to all students (in addition to individual feedback in each group repository)
