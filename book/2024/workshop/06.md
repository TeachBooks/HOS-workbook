# Fault Tree Workshop

This workshop builds on the [System Reliability](https://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/risk-reliability/reliability-system/overview.html) concepts from MUDE by introducing Fault Trees: a graphical method for conceptualizing and evaluating system reliability. After a brief introduction to fault trees, a case study (the Afsluitdijk) will be introduced, after which you will work in groups to evaluate system reliability.
