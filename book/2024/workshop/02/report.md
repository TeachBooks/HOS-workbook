# Extreme Value Analysis for Hydraulic and Offshore structures

Complete the tasks in `Analysis.ipynb` then answer the following questions.

This assignment will be graded as described on the Unit Website [here](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design-24/info/#grading). In addition, you will earn a higher grade if you implement more than 1 technique to validate the threshold.

Remember that your report is expected to be well-formatted, which means you take advantage of Markdown features and include tables and figures to explain your reasoning (this does _not_ mean include a _lot_ of figures, but rather, use figures to help explain your answer).

Note that while there are placeholders in the notebook for you to write answers/interpretation, these are for your own learning, and will not be graded directly.

Don't forget to **email Robert your group member info**, as described on [this page](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design-24/info/#groups).

1. What is the design requirement?

_Your answer here._

2. In the working notebook, you have different steps to 'clean' the data and analyze the storms that generate extreme events. Based on the results of the those analysis, which data should we consider for our EVA? Why? 

_Your answer here._

3. List the methods that you have used to perform Extreme Value Analysis and briefly describe how they are applied and their differences.

_Your answer here._

4. Compare the results obtained from both Extreme Value Analysis methods. What are the differences? Which method would you choose?
    
You can compare the following aspects:
- Goodness of fit of both distributions to the sampled observations.
- Obtained return level plots.
- Obtained design value.

_Your answer here._

5. You were asked to apply at least one validation method to justify whether a threshold=5m and a declustering time=72h are reasonable or not. Describe your conclusion and reasoning here.

_Your answer here._

6. You will be expected to apply EVA in your B Module projects/exercises later in the quarter in a similar way to this workshop. This question is a chace to let us know if you do not yet feel comfortable doing that. Use the space below to let us know if you have any questions or suggestions for what we could do to make sure this goes smoothly for you.

_An answer to this question is optional._
