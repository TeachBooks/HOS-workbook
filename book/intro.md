# Welcome to the HOS Workbook

This book is a place to share a variety of material that doesn't necessarily fit into other online textbooks or websites use in the Hydraulic and Offshore Structures (HOS) Track in the Civil Engineering MSc Program at TU Delft. Many pages will use the interactive Python feature to demonstrate and enable the use of Python code for computational exercises.  

```{note}
This workbook is created for Q4 of the 2023-24 academic year. Although we will try to preserve links in the future using the year as part of the address for each page (e.g., `teachbooks.github.io/HOS-workbook/2024/...`), it is not guaranteed to stay in place beyond the end of Q3 the following year. Interactive pages will be maintained at least until the end of Q4 this year. Contact Robert Lanzafame with questions or issues.

## HOS Track B Modules

_This website is for the B **modules** in the Hydraulic and Offshore Structures (HOS) **track** in the Civil Engineering MSc **program** at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. In this case, the term "unit" can be considered synonymous with the term "course."_

The Hydraulic and Offshore Structures (HOS) **track** offers a choice between three **B modules** during the fourth quarter of Year 1, each of which focuses on a different set of structures:
- <a href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=63755" target="_blank">CIEM4210 Marine Renewables</a>
- <a href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=63756" target="_blank">CIEM4220 Dams, Dikes and Breakwaters</a>
- <a href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=63757" target="_blank">CIEM4230 Floating and Submerged Structures</a>

Each B module has three **units**:

1. Unit B-1 Probabilistic Design,
2. Unit B-2 Computational Modelling, and
3. Unit B-3, which covers design aspects of the specific structures related to each module listed above.
 
 The units **Probabilistic Design** and **Computational Modelling** introduce fundamental methods that are independent of the structure considered and essential for all three B modules.
